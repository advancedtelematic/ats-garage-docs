== Get Credentials

////
Provide instructions on how to obtain authentication credentials. -- >

Sample text: All users of HERE APIs must obtain authentication and
authorization credentials and provide them as values for the parameters
app_id and app_code. The credentials are assigned per application.

This document uses the placeholder text \{YOUR_APP_ID} and
\{YOUR_APP_CODE} as placeholders for access and authorization
credentials. Replace these placeholders with your own unique
application-specific credentials to access the API resources. ```
