== Task 1

////
The title of a task topic states the task using a bare-infinitive verb. For example:

    Create a Catalog
    Get Metadata
    ...

The structure of the topic should be:

1. Opening paragraph that sets the context for the task. Why would you need to perform the task? Are there any prerequisites?
Link off to concept topics if there are important concepts if necessary. Use multiple paragraphs if needed.

2. The procedure. Procedures are ordered lists of steps. Be very specific when writing steps. Provide example values where the user needs to specify a value.

3. Example (if appropriate). For REST, show an example request and response. For libraries, show
how to perform the task and how to use the results in a practical way.
