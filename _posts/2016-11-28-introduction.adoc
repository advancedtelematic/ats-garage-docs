prerequisites

- Yocto version: krogoth
- poky

* download the meta-updater layer
* download the BSP layer

what do i need to know?

- adding to the bitbake process to push to the OSTree repo
- how OSTree works, in depth (read the OSTree docs)

  - /var is special:
    - initially empty, things you put there persist through full filesystem updates
  

  - /usr
    - 

  - /etc
    - funky 3-way merge behaviour

BSP support is all about tuning uboot to work with OSTree

- add configuration to your uboot to:
  - read the config from uEnv.txt
  - load the specified kernel
  - checking which deployment (i.e., which OSTree commit) to boot
