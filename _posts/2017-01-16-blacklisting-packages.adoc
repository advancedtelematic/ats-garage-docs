ATS Garage lets you blacklist packages that you don't want to be installed on your devices. You might blacklist a package, for example, if it has a critical security vulnerability, or if it's deprecated and its support window has run out.

To really understand package blacklisting, it's important to recognize the two different types of package information ATS Garage maintains. If you go to any device page and look at the Software pane, you can switch between showing packages that are "In Garage" and ones that are "On Device".

Packages in the "On Device" view are populated by that device's client, based on what the system itself reports as being installed. They can't necessarily be modified directly; for example, if the device is updated with link:../bas/yocto-ostree-and-treehub.html[OSTree], its updates are full-filesystem images, not individual packages.

Packages in the "In Garage" view are packages or system images you've uploaded to the Garage or pushed to TreeHub. You can install these on your devices. For systems where you manage updates with a package manager, that means you can upload new versions and update the individual package. For system images that contain blacklisted packages, you'll need to build an image with a non-blacklisted package version. You can then update the affected devices to the new image.
