The Devices tab is where you can see all of your managed devices, and drag and drop to organize them into groups.

You can group devices for your own convenience in organizing your devices, but groups are also how you target link:../feat/update-campaigns.html[update campaigns], so it's a good idea to make groups of devices that will be receiving the same updates--for example, grouping by model number or QA group.
