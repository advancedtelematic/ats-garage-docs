The ATS Garage client is a small daemon that you install on your device. Its main function is to check for and download updates, and then either install the updates itself, or pass them off to some external program to be installed. It also can report useful information about the device back to ATS Garage.

The most important function of the client, downloading and installing updates, can be done in three different (and mutually exclusive) ways: with OSTree and TreeHub for Yocto/OpenEmbedded-based systems, with a package manager (dpkg or RPM), or with an external software installer that you provide. The Yocto/OSTree/TreeHub option is the best option for any embedded system (link:../bas/yocto-ostree-and-treehub.html[learn more]).

To learn more, try out our link:../start-yocto/your-first-ostreeenabled-yocto-project.html[Getting started with Yocto] project. Or, if you already have a Yocto-based project and you'd like to add over-the-air update support to it, read link:../start-yocto/adding-ostree-updates-to-your-existing-yocto-project.html[Adding OSTree to your existing Yocto project].

If you just want to try out the client and you don't want to wait for your Yocto distro to build, you can also download it as a deb or rpm package. You'll then be able to upload deb/rpm packages to ATS Garage, and manage their installation from there. This isn't a great model for actual production use, but we support it as an easy way to get started.

In automotive applications, it's common to have a telematics control unit (TCU) that handles updating firmware for other ECUs in the vehicle over various buses. You can use ATS Garage to manage those updates and update campaigns. The ATS Garage client can report system information from the TCU to ATS Garage, allowing you to easily target update campaigns to just the devices that need them, and use the client's link:../cli-dev/client-commandevent-api.html[command/event API] to initialize and report on the installs.
