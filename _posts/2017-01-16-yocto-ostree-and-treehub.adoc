If you've started working on an embedded software project, you've probably reached the point where you looked around for an update system, and found out that there isn't a lot of great tooling out there. Our experience has been that people tend implement software updates on a case-by-case basis, leading to solutions that are specific to the target platform, proprietary, brittle, or insecure--or sometimes all of the above. ATS Garage provides an open source solution that you can plug-and-play into your build process.

Let's look at the parts of the system, and how they fit together.

== Yocto

The link:https://www.yoctoproject.org/[Yocto Project] is an open source collaborative project that provides standardized high-quality infrastructure, tools, and methodology to help decrease the complexity and increase the portability of Linux implementations in the embedded industry. It enables its users to build custom operating systems using specific recipes for embedded devices. Most commercial embedded linux distros already use and/or support Yocto, including link:http://www.windriver.com/announces/wind-river-linux-8/[Wind River] and link:http://www.enea.com/solutions/Enea-Linux/[Enea]. It's backed by major hardware vendors like Intel, AMD, Freescale, Mentor, Texas Instruments, and many others. If you need a highly performant customized linux for your embedded device, whether it's IoT, automotive, or other kinds of mobility devices, the Yocto project is probably what you're using.

ATS has created a `meta-updater` layer for Yocto, making it easy to get over-the-air update support into your devices. In many cases, it's as simple as adding meta-updater and a board support integration layer to your project and re-running bitbake. The main feature of the meta-updater layer is OSTree.

== OSTree

link:http://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[OSTree] is an open-source tool that combines a "git-like" model for committing and downloading bootable filesystem trees, along with a layer for deploying them and managing the bootloader configuration. It is actively developed and support by Red Hat, and used in link:http://flatpak.org/[flatpak] and link:http://www.projectatomic.io/[Project Atomic].

For more on why OSTree is the best tool for the job of doing embedded device updates, take a look at link:http://docs.atsgarage.com/ostree/ostree-vs-dual-bank-systems.html[OSTree vs. dual-bank systems].

(If you're contemplating trying to do embedded software updates using a generic package manager or by rebooting into an "update mode", take a deep breath and think about your life choices.)

== TreeHub

Since OSTree is "git-like", you can probably imagine that you can have remote repositories. TreeHub is exactly that. It's seamlessly integrated into the meta-updater layer and into the ATS Garage site itself. Your builds get automatically pushed to TreeHub as soon as you make them, and you can use ATS Garage to wirelessly update your devices--one at a time, or in targeted campaigns. You can even set devices to automatically pull updates from TreeHub as soon as they're pushed, and stop wasting time re-flashing the units on your test bench every time you build new code.
