If you already have a Yocto-based project that you want to update using {product-name}, you just need to do four things to get started:

1.  Clone the https://github.com/advancedtelematic/meta-updater[meta-updater] layer and add it to your https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.1/ref-manual/ref-manual.html#structure-build-conf-bblayers.conf[bblayers.conf].
2.  Clone a BSP integration layer (`meta-updater-$\{PLATFORM}`, e.g. https://github.com/advancedtelematic/meta-updater-raspberrypi[meta-updater-raspberrypi]) and add it to your conf/bblayers.conf. If your board isn't supported yet, you could write a BSP integration for it yourself. See the <<Adding support for your board>> section for the details.
3.  Set up your https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.1/ref-manual/ref-manual.html#var-DISTRO[distro]. If you are using "poky", the default distro in Yocto, you can change it in your conf/local.conf to "poky-sota". Alternatively, if you are using your own or a third-party distro configuration, you can add `INHERIT += " sota"` to it, thus combining the capabilities of your distro with meta-updater features.
4.  {app-url}/#/profile/access-keys[Create a provisioning key, window="_blank"] and add it to your local.conf.

You can then build your image as usual, with bitbake. After building the root file system, bitbake will then create an https://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/adapting-existing/[OSTree-enabled version] of it, commit it to your local OSTree repo, and push it to {product-name-short}. Additionally, a live disk image will be created (normally named $\{IMAGE_NAME}.-sdimg-ota e.g. core-image-raspberrypi3.rpi-sdimg-ota). You can control this behaviour through <<variables in your local.conf,{product-name-short}-related variables in your local.conf>>.

== Supported boards

Currently supported platforms are

* https://github.com/advancedtelematic/meta-updater-raspberrypi[Raspberry Pi3]
* https://github.com/advancedtelematic/meta-updater-minnowboard[Minnowboard]
* https://github.com/advancedtelematic/meta-updater-porter[Renesas R-Car M2 Porter board]
* https://github.com/advancedtelematic/meta-updater-qemux86-64[Native QEMU emulation]

=== Adding support for your board

If your board isn't supported yet, you can add board integration code yourself. The main purpose of this code is to provide a bootloader that will be able to use https://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/atomic-upgrades/[OSTree's boot directory]. In the meta-updater integration layers we have written so far, the basic steps are:

1.  Make the board boot into http://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot[U-Boot].
2.  Make U-boot import variables from /boot/loader/uEnv.txt and load the kernel with initramfs and kernel command line arguments according to what is set in this file.

You may take a look into the https://github.com/advancedtelematic/meta-updater-minnowboard[Minnowboard] or https://github.com/advancedtelematic/meta-updater-raspberrypi[Raspberry Pi] integration layers for examples.

Although in the BSP layers we've created so far we've used U-Boot, other boot loaders can be configured to work with OSTree as well.

== {product-name-short}-related variables in local.conf

* OSTREE_REPO - path to your OSTree repository. Defaults to "$\{DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}/ostree_repo"
* OSTREE_BRANCHNAME - the branch your rootfs will be committed to. Defaults to "ota"
* OSTREE_OSNAME - OS deployment name on your target device. For more information about deployments and osnames see the https://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/deployment/[OSTree documentation]. Defaults to "poky".
* OSTREE_INITRAMFS_IMAGE - initramfs/initrd image that is used as a proxy while booting into an OSTree deployment. Do not change this setting unless you are sure that your initramfs can serve as such a proxy.
* SOTA_PACKED_CREDENTIALS - A zipped provisioning key bundle downloaded from {product-name-short}, as a fully qualified path.
* SOTA_CLIENT - Which SOTA client to install. This is mostly a legacy option; the default client, *aktualizr*, is our recommended solution. *rvi-sota-client* is our former client, written in Rust.
