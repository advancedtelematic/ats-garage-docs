Often, the reason you need to run an update campaign is that you've discovered a bug or security hole in something that's currently deployed. {product-name} lets you blacklist packages and images, and shows you how many of your devices are affected by the blacklisted version.

It's important to understand the distinction here between a package and an image. {product-name-short}, by default, manages full filesystem images built by Yocto. Each filesystem image also has a manifest of the software packages installed on it.

You can blacklist either an image or a package. Either way, the *Impact Analysis* tab will report how many of your devices are affected by the packages you've blacklisted.

== Blacklisting a package

To blacklist an individual package, go to the link:../usage/device-page.html[device page] of a device that has the package installed, click the image that contains the package, find it in the list, and click the ban icon:

== Blacklisting an image

To blacklist a whole image, just click the ban icon next to the image.

== Impact analysis

The {app-url}/#/impact-analysis[*Impact analysis* tab, window="_blank"] lets you view stats about the impact of packages you've blacklisted to help you make decisions about your update priorities. Results are dynamically updated as your vehicles complete update campaigns.
