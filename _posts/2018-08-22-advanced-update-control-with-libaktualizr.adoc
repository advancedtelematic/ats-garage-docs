// TODO MERLIN: Figure out if we even want to try to document this beyond what is mentioned on the introduction page. Frankly, I think I doubt it. If you're using libaktualizr, what you probably want is code, doxygen docs, and the example hmi_stub app. Anything we can add here might just be cruft.

// MC: I think we can add valuable content rather than cruft. We'll need some standard "getting started" content (For reference, see the Tracking C client library: https://docs.in.here.com/ci/location_tracking_c/hlp/1.0.0/ed15c72/html/dev_guide/#topics/getting-started.html )

The aktualizr client is designed to be run as a standalone component on an embedded system and can manage the entire software update process. However, you might have requirements that got beyond what the standalone client can provide.

For example, some in-vehicle interfaces are proprietary and under NDA, so their implementation must be kept separate from Aktualizr. You might want to integrate the OTA update functionality yourself and minimize the involvement of external consultants.

For this purpose, you can also use libaktualizr to make your own OTA update client. Typical scenarios for making your own client could be:

* You want to integrate {product-name} functionality with a third-party HMI
* You want to integrate {product-name} with a third-party interface that installs software on secondary ECUs
* You want to constrain network traffic and software updates to specific vehicle states
* You want to provide motorists or service staff with progress indicators for specific software updates.

To get started with libaktualizr see the  https://github.com/advancedtelematic/aktualizr/tree/master/src/hmi_stub[reference client] and the https://advancedtelematic.github.io/aktualizr/class_aktualizr.html[reference documentation].
