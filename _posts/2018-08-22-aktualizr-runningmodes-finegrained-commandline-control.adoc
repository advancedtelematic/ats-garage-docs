// TODO MERLIN: I've already written a doc in the aktualizr repo that contains the information we need here: https://github.com/advancedtelematic/aktualizr/blob/master/docs/selectively-triggering-aktualizr.adoc. You could use an include::[] to poach that (or sections of it) directly, or rewrite if you think that would be better. You might want to check with Patrick that the info there is still up to date; I vaguely remember hearing someone say something about adding another running-mode, and I hate reading C++ so I haven't looked at the code to check.
