////
      This is a kind of "How to" topic which is more in tutorial format. 
      We propose one for updating primaries and one for updating secondaries. But you're welcome to add more.
      
      Use this topic to provide detailed step-by-step instuctions on how to interatively build
      up your code until you have a full working example.

      For inspiration, see these Tutorials: 
      http://www.linuxhowtos.org/C_C++/socket.htm
      http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LinuxTutorialC++CGI.html
      (Ignore the hideous formatting)

// Include examples from your sources files like this

Example of including source code with line numbers

[source,c++,subs=attributes+]
----
include::{baseurl}{branch}/src/libaktualizr/bootloader/bootloader.cc[lines=27..41]
----

Example of including source code with tagged comments.

[source,bash]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/advancedtelematic/ota-community-edition/master/scripts/start.sh[tags="genserverkeys"]
----

This approach is preferred, becasue it lets other developers know which sections of the code are included in the documentation.
