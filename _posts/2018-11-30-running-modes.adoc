      This should be a reference topic that is similar to 
      https://docs.atsgarage.com/client-config/aktualizr-runningmodes-finegrained-commandline-control.html

      (source: ../client-config/aktualizr-runningmodes-finegrained-commandline-control.adoc)

      ...but with code examples applicable to libaktualizr

      Feel free to add other reference topics like this one.

      For example, you might want to incorporate a topic like this one: https://github.com/advancedtelematic/aktualizr/blob/master/docs/configuration.adoc

      However, remember that reference topics should NOT contain detailed conceptual information or procedures.
      Reference topics contain lists of items with simple descriptions and links to more info if necessary 
      (much like the auto generated Doxygen docs)
